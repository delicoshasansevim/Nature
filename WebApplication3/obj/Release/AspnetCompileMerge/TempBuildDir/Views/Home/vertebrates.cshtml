        Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata /-??/ 
        (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, 
        with currently about 64,000 species described.[3] Vertebrates include the jawless fish and 
        the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.

        A bony fish clade known as the lobe-finned fishes is included with tetrapods, which are further 
        divided into amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Extant vertebrates range in size from the 
        frog species Paedophryne amauensis, at as little as 7.7 mm (0.30 in), to the blue whale, at up 
        to 33 m (108 ft). Vertebrates make up less than five percent of all described animal species; the 
        rest are invertebrates, which lack vertebral columns.

        The vertebrates traditionally include the hagfish, which do not have proper vertebrae due to their 
        loss in evolution,[4] though their closest living relatives, the lampreys, do.[5] Hagfish do, however, 
        possess a cranium. For this reason, the vertebrate subphylum is sometimes referred to as "Craniata" 
        when discussing morphology.

        Molecular analysis since 1992 has suggested that hagfish are most closely related to lampreys,[6] and 
        so also are vertebrates in a monophyletic sense. Others consider them a sister group of vertebrates 
        in the common taxon of craniata.[7]
